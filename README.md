# Glacier_Model

I just uploaded my climate change glacier model for review. It is the newest version of my glacier model. I am still having a difficult time figuring how to make the model run faster. In this case, I am running it over 11000 years at a timestep of 0.1 years. But, I do not want to make my timestep bigger. I am thinking of converting the model to a movie, but I only know how to do that on MATLAB.
